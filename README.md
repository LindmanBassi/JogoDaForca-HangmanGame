# Hangman Game in Java

This is a classic **hangman game** developed in Java. The goal is to guess a secret word before running out of attempts. Players input letters, and the program checks if they are part of the secret word, updating progress or reducing the remaining attempts.

## Features

- **Word Loading**:  
  Words can be loaded from an external file (`yourpath.txt`) or a default built-in word list.

- **Random Selection**:  
  A word is randomly selected from the loaded list for the game.

- **Dynamic Attempt Count**:  
  The number of attempts is based on the length of the secret word.

- **Thematic Words**:  
  Includes a default word list with generic words and an optional list of League of Legends champions.
